# Retail Forecast Model
### Business Case
Sales data originated from retail stores from a typical retail chain usually contains billions of records. It can present multiple stores and products sales amounts by number of items sold. Each item from a specific store can be sold at very different rate than that of others. So, to forecast future demands (number of items to be sold per day) we need to consider the historical trend as store-item pair. In this project, we utilize a sample dataset, typical of a retail chain, and developed a forecasting strategy.
